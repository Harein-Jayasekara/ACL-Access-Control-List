# ACL-Access-Control-List
If ya wanna know a way on how you want to limit the accessibility of any device to a given network,this will come in handy...
#Note this well..
  The upload of ACL2 containing the configurations of the seen devices may change as DHCP has been used and applied on every routing device of the network,so for such a case,note down the changing values like the ip of the devices and proceed in your configurations..
  
  The reason for the above scenario is due to the APIPA fucnctionality that takes place when the DHCP protocol does not carry out it's functionality.
